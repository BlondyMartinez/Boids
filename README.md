# Unreal Boid Simulation üê¶
## Overview
This project implements a 3D Boid simulation in Unreal Engine, simulating the flocking behavior of birds. The simulation allows you to adjust various parameters via a user-friendly UI and interactively spawn, delete boids, obstacles, and predators to observe their impact on flocking behavior.

## Features
- Flocking Behavior: Simulates flocking behavior including alignment, cohesion, and separation.
- Adjustable Parameters via UI:
  - Color Bias: Adjusts the color bias of boids.
  - Repulsion: Controls how boids avoid each other based on color.
  - Containment: Defines boundaries to keep boids within a specific area.
  - Obstacles: Allows spawning and deleting obstacles that boids avoid while navigating.
  - Predators: Enables spawning and deleting predators that boids flee from to simulate predator-prey dynamics.
  - Hash Partitioning: Optimizes performance using hash partitioning for efficient neighbor searching.
## Getting Started
- Clone the Repository.
- Open in Unreal Engine.
- Explore the Project:
  - Navigate to the Boid simulation scene.
  - Use the UI controls to adjust parameters such as color bias, repulsion strength, containment area, and more.
  - Interactively spawn and delete boids, obstacles, and predators to observe their effect on flocking behavior.
## Usage
UI Controls: Adjust parameters and interact with the simulation via the provided UI controls.
